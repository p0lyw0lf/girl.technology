  This is the home of a site whose vision is outlined at
  <a href="https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/girl.technology"
    >https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/girl.technology</a
  >.

{% set example_url = "wolf" | category_to_url %}
<p>
  Basically, this site is a link directory, where you can add your own links to
  a fancy URL. For example, because the file
  <a href="https://wolfgirl.dev/.well-known/girl.technology"
    >https://wolfgirl.dev/.well-known/girl.technology</a
  >
  exists and is the string "wolf", the page
  <a href="{{ example_url | safe }}">{{ example_url | safe }}</a> contains the
  url <a href="https://wolfgirl.dev/">https://wolfgirl.dev/</a> (my blog!).
</p>
<p>
  You can add your own page by going to <a href="/new">/new</a> and following
  the instructions. Do it! <a href="/new">Do it now!!!</a>
